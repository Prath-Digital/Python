# Polymorphism in Python Questions and Answers

## Q1. What is polymorphism in Python, and how does it relate to Object-Oriented Programming?
Polymorphism is the ability of different classes to be treated as instances of the same class through a common interface. In Python, it relates to OOP by allowing methods to be used interchangeably on different objects, promoting flexibility and reusability.

## Q2. Explain how polymorphism is implemented in Python with an example involving classes.
Polymorphism in Python can be achieved through method overriding or duck typing. Here's an example with classes:
```python
class Cat:
    def sound(self):
        return "Meow"

class Dog:
    def sound(self):
        return "Woof"

animals = [Cat(), Dog()]
for animal in animals:
    print(animal.sound())
```
Output: "Meow" and "Woof". The same method `sound()` behaves differently based on the object.

## Q3. What are the advantages of using polymorphism in programming?
- **Flexibility**: Code can work with objects of different classes seamlessly.
- **Reusability**: Reduces code duplication by using a common interface.
- **Extensibility**: New classes can be added without modifying existing code.

## Q4. What is method overloading in Python, and how can it be simulated using default arguments? Provide an example.
Python does not support method overloading natively (like in Java). It can be simulated using default arguments. Example:
```python
class Calculator:
    def add(self, a, b=0, c=0):
        return a + b + c

calc = Calculator()
print(calc.add(2))      # Output: 2
print(calc.add(2, 3))   # Output: 5
print(calc.add(2, 3, 4))# Output: 9
```
Default arguments allow the method to handle varying numbers of parameters.

## Q5. Explain method overriding in Python with an example involving inheritance.
Method overriding occurs when a child class provides a specific implementation of a method already defined in its parent class. Example:
```python
class Animal:
    def speak(self):
        return "Some sound"

class Dog(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        return "Woof"

dog = Dog()
print(dog.speak())  # Output: Woof
```
The `Dog` class overrides the `speak` method from `Animal`.

## Q6. What is the key difference between method overloading and method overriding?
- **Method Overloading**: Involves multiple methods with the same name but different parameters (not natively supported in Python, simulated with default arguments).
- **Method Overriding**: Involves redefining a parent class method in a child class during inheritance.

## Q7. Write a program that demonstrates method overriding using a base class Animal and a derived class Dog.
```python
class Animal:
    def speak(self):
        return "Some generic sound"

class Dog(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        return "Woof"

# Create instances and test
animal = Animal()
dog = Dog()
print(animal.speak())  # Output: Some generic sound
print(dog.speak())     # Output: Woof
```

## Q8. What is the purpose of the issubclass() function in Python? Provide an example.
The `issubclass()` function checks if a class is a subclass of another class. Example:
```python
class Parent:
    pass

class Child(Parent):
    pass

print(issubclass(Child, Parent))  # Output: True
print(issubclass(Parent, Child))  # Output: False
```
It helps determine inheritance relationships.

## Q9. What is the super() function in Python, and how is it used in inheritance? Provide an example.
The `super()` function calls a method from the parent class. Example:
```python
class Parent:
    def greet(self):
        return "Hello from Parent"

class Child(Parent):
    def greet(self):
        return super().greet() + " and Child"

child = Child()
print(child.greet())  # Output: Hello from Parent and Child
```
It ensures the parent method is executed in the child class.

## Q10. What are the benefits of using super() in multi-level or multiple inheritance scenarios?
- **Avoids Repetition**: Calls parent methods without hardcoding class names.
- **Maintainability**: Simplifies updates in inheritance chains.
- **Flexibility**: Works seamlessly in complex multi-level or multiple inheritance scenarios.
